ashCoin

ashCoin is a cryptocurrency with which I'm testing my JS Blockchain.


Currently it is only working on the client side and it is not saving any data. There is an AJAX implementation planned so 
progress can be stored server side. Created addresses are not going to be saved! The balance of an address can't be calculated correctly yet (so you have infinite money) . Also Blocks can't be mined yet (however the receiver wouldn't get the money anyways).
